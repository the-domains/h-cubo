is located near Albufeira, between the golf and the beach, at Herdade dos Salgados. With majestic interiors, its design is contemporary, however cosy. Here, you will find plenty to spend your time. In the morning, walk along the Salgados Beach or explore the Salgados Lagoon. Later in the day, lounge around one the 3 outdoor pools, before a massage in the magnificent SPA. By late afternoon, save some time for an aperitif in the Sunset Bar, whilst enjoying, in the horizon over the nature reserve, the spectacle of colours after which the bar was named, followed by dinner in one of our restaurants. The hotel has 228 accommodation units and features great facilities, as well as a modern Congress Centre, the biggest private owned congress center in Portugal. If your looking for holidays in 5 star hotels in Albufeira near the beach, the hotel Salgados Palace is the best of both worlds, a place where design and comfort walk hand-in-hand, between the golf and the beach.</p></div></div></div></div></section><section id="section-h_GraphicalLargeColumn-2155f0f3-91f1-4581-a340-26527c0ed1e3" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title color-bg section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0 text-align-left group-order-normal  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="158"><div class="Component ms-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="159"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-66p w-100p ms-w-66p" data-reactid="160"><span class="" data-reactid="161"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="162"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="163"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/9989a5c387e31136ef2e5b9434229ec7/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ff5d99ba3-4834-4edf-8326-2478e89942fd.jpg&amp;width=1440" style="object-position:54.736328125% 70.50086107921929%;" data-reactid="164"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/eb1f81bc72be822a3a71ff4f65747aac/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ff5d99ba3-4834-4edf-8326-2478e89942fd.jpg&amp;width=1280" style="object-position:54.736328125% 70.50086107921929%;" data-reactid="165"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/d38aa0970531e6797f0ff630f10ae90f/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ff5d99ba3-4834-4edf-8326-2478e89942fd.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:54.736328125% 70.50086107921929%;" data-reactid="166"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/c10e021af35063f4dfdce8c76a8f5e12/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ff5d99ba3-4834-4edf-8326-2478e89942fd.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:54.736328125% 70.50086107921929%;" data-reactid="167"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="1600" data-height="871" data-ratio="1.8369690011481057" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/9989a5c387e31136ef2e5b9434229ec7/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ff5d99ba3-4834-4edf-8326-2478e89942fd.jpg&amp;width=1440" style="object-position:54.736328125% 70.50086107921929%;" data-reactid="168"/></picture></div></span></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-2 ms-p-h-5 ms-p-v-3 ls-p-v-8 fx-b-33p color-title" data-reactid="169"><div class="System-font  Headline" data-reactid="170"><h1 data-reactid="171"><span class="" data-reactid="172"><span class="font-title" data-reactid="173">BJORN MOERMAN</span></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 174 --><!-- react-empty: 175 --><div class="m-b-05" data-reactid="176"><!-- react-text: 177 --> <!-- /react-text --><div class="Paragraph Caption m-t-1 l-h-m  " data-reactid="178"><p data-reactid="179">Today, my post is dedicated to Bjorn Moerman, a freelance ARCHITECTURAL, AVIATION and TRAVELphotographer, based in Dubai.
Over the years, He had the honour to work for an extensive selection of international clients and his photography has been published in a large variety of books and magazines including National Geographic, Flight International, Architecture and Urbanism, Frame and many more…
In the Summer of 2014, He was honoured to be chosen as an ambassador for Fujifilm, becoming one of their official X Photographers...please enjoy his stunning work!
