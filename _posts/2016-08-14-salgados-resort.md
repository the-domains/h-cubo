  The hotel Salgados Palace is located near Albufeira, between the golf and the
  beach, at Herdade dos Salgados. With majestic interiors, its design is
  contemporary, however cosy. Here, you will find plenty to spend your time. In
  the morning, walk along the Salgados Beach or explore the Salgados Lagoon.
  Later in the day, lounge around one the 3 outdoor pools, before a massage in
  the magnificent SPA. By late afternoon, save some time for an aperitif in the
  Sunset Bar, whilst enjoying, in the horizon over the nature reserve, the
  spectacle of colours after which the bar was named, followed by dinner in one
  of our restaurants. The hotel has 228 accommodation units and features great
  facilities, as well as a modern Congress Centre, the biggest private owned
  congress center in Portugal. If your looking for holidays in 5 star hotels in
  Albufeira near the beach, the hotel Salgados Palace is the best of both
  worlds, a place where design and comfort walk hand-in-hand, between the golf
  and the beach.
